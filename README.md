# Movie Collection

## Description

_Duration: 13 Hours _

I have created an app where you can store a collection of movies. If you click on a poster, it takes you to the information page for that movie. it includes a description and the genres associated with the movie. You can click on the "Go Back" button to go back to the collection. You can also add a new movie by clicking on the button on the home screen. It requires all inputs to be filled out including at least one geenre. If those conditions are not met you will recieve an alert. After you hit submit, the button brings you back to the collecton.

### Prerequisites

vsCode or alternative, 
Postico or alternative

## Installation

1. Create a database named "saga_movies_weekend",
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Built With
vsCode, Postico2, Postman, javascript, react, sagas, reducers, redux, css
